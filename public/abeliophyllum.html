        flowering plants in the olive
        family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species, <span class="bold">Abeliophyllum distichum</span> Nakai, endemic
        to Korea, where it is
        endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having white,
